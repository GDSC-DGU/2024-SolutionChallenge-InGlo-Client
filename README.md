## Getting_Started

### What is Inglo?

<p align="center">

***`Let's find out the issues of SDGS around the world, and let's solve them all together!`*** 
 As of 2019, aid to Africa and underdeveloped countries were on the rise before the COVID-19 outbreak, but after the COVID-19 outbreak, the UN predicted that aid to middle- and low-income countries, which are the economic lifeline of numerous poor families, would decrease. UNESCO said that 'sustainable development goals' are the last of the SDGS goals, but they are also the underlying goals for achieving other goals. 
 Global partnership refers to cooperation between governments, private, civil society, and comprehensive partnerships at the global, regional, and national levels. Among the detailed goals of Goal 17, there is "encouraging and promoting effective public, public-private, and civil society partnerships based on the financing strategies and experiences of partnership institutions." Just as partnerships between public and private civil society in one country are important, our team thought that promoting global partnerships with citizens of other countries would eventually contribute to public partnerships. Therefore, the service was planned with the aim of achieving SDGS through global partnerships.

## What is Sustainable Development Goals?

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/33146152/160327143-e36bb1b9-ccea-4f96-b3b2-d92338dd56c5.png)

The Sustainable Development Goals (SGDs) or Global Goals are a collection of 17 interlinked global goals designed to be a "blueprint to achieve a better and more sustainable future for all.
As can be seen in the figure above, there are 17 goals.

### Our goal

A flutter application was created by selecting several of the UN's 17 sustainable development goals. SDGS and sustainable development goals were thought to be a global partnership, and they planned to get to know each other by sharing issue data from around the world. In the planning process, Google's design print methodology was used, and I thought that the process of deriving a solution sketch from this methodology was good for deriving and developing ideas.

#### Global Partners Growing Together

![sdgs17](https://github.com/bianbbc87/new/assets/129590633/ee16cf29-3ebd-458f-9453-a5060d143b04)

Users of the app can check the news of the selected SDGS category while using this app and host a solution sketch. They can also share their opinions on the news with people and friends all over the world. In addition, they can form a global partnership by creating a post that cites their solution sketch and exchanging feedback with each other.

### The reason why we named "inglo"

<img width="499" alt="스크린샷 2024-02-26 오전 9 45 48" src="https://github.com/bianbbc87/new/assets/129590633/4172af63-407a-44e6-9656-9ac95ba2671a">

inglo is a combination of insight and global, and I thought that receiving and sharing SDGS news data would broaden global insight. Since we respect each other and promote global partnerships through various activities such as solution sketch, post, and feedback, our team added several national images to the cover instead of using simple words to start the app, and the logo was created in the form of a globe reminiscent of global.

Users can promote "global impact" along with their own activities. It was inspired by github's rank system. The higher the global impact, the more users have tried to contribute to SDGS resolution.

## AI part ( New Feature )
#### Preview
The previous model was not the one we finally wanted. It was a model that classified only four things and could not be processed in real time. However, after mentoring at this gdsc, we were finally able to implement the method we wanted.

<p align="center">
<img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/87767242/172432196-fbbd64a9-20c5-42cd-aa6d-40e24e334c30.gif" alt="text" width="400"  />
</p>
Real-time object detection and image labeling functions are used to implement more effective plogging. It recognizes several objects as shown, and among them, it is possible to be plogging the target red rectangle. The implementation of this used object detection among ML kits supported by Google, and this function was recommended to us by a mentor during gdsc mentoring. It was easy to use these features during the few remaining deadlines, and the results were successful.

#### Doing Plogging
<p align="center">

</p>

After taking a picture of trash, it automatically recognizes and sorts trash so that user can see at a glance what kind of garbage user picked up. 

## Finish

</p>

If you stop plogging and jogging is over, you can take pictures of the surrounding landscape, and if you press finish, your records are saved on the server. If you press the share button on the right, you can immediately write down your own post in the community.

After the plogging activity, you can share photos of you running activities, surrounding landscapes, or your trash to the community. Check out the records of your friends or people in the same area and leave feedback! If you click the view button on the post, you can check various information such as exercise distance, time, and number of plogging.

```
Lets share and brag!

You can donate with points collected through plogging activities. If this app is supported by the government or city, we think it will be able to support more disadvantaged neighbors. Wouldn't it be proud if you donated the points you've worked hard for running and blogging to neighbors in need? Currently, donations can be made to large-scale volunteer organizations such as UNICEF and save-the-childeren.

## Map cluster

Map clustering makes it easier to see where garbage is concentrated visually, and we want to take action on where garbage is concentrated intensively.

## Recycle Bigdata and EPR(Extended producer responsibility)

<img width="300" alt="ranking" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/87767242/161151267-16ecbbe9-0d13-47d1-b715-2e89e8e950d1.jpg">

After collecting various data such as waste manufacturers, locations, and numbers, I want to apply EPR to manufacturers. A certain amount of recycling obligations are granted to manufacturers to recycle, and if they fail to comply with this, the producer is charged a recycling charge above the cost required for recycling.

## Various profile decorations

<p align="center">
<img width="200" alt="ranking" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/87767242/161201288-221bb6c8-baf6-409c-ae84-b9604a552a32.gif">

</p>
It's a little boring to just use points for donations. If we collect points, we will buy something that allows us to decorate our profiles with special effects that move our profiles, and show off our decorated profiles in the community. This will allow people to collect more points.

## Trash can location

Picking up trash isn't the end of it. Since it has to be handled properly, users can check the location of the trash can during plogging, and other users can see the location of the trash can displayed.
